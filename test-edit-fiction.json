A fashionable and delicious cafe on the east side of Tokyo overlooking the destroyed old radio tower - there you'll find Café LycoReco.

Delicious sweets, gun action, games, human drama, zombies and monsters, road movies ...... and a hint of love! And of course, coffee and helping people! Whatever your order...... we can handle it!
